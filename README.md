##1. Introduction to the Problem

Nowadays, the Deep Learning Area use lots of  different libraries, dependicies, script languages, some of the most known are:
- Caff√® (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/);
- Tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/);
- Keras (http://keras.io/);
- OpenCV (http://opencv.org/).

So Develop & Research on Deep Learning, now means struggle with lots of error, compilation, installation, and some times most of them comes from updates, new library dependecies, let's see which are the possible solutions.

##2. Possible Solutions

Mainly we have three solutions:
- Install on own machine;
- Install in a server (Use the environment remotly);
- Install on Virtual Environment.
This last one is the one, covered in this Tutorial.

##3. Virtual Environment

**Why Virtual Environment?**

Why is easy, Virtual Envirorments lets us to have different dependencies, libraries, updates, of the same or different software, without struggling with error due to mislink or new apis.

Let's see a four step set up installation for our Research Envirorment with Tensorflow, OpenCV, Python, CUDA and all the libraries that we could need:

### i.Virtual Environment & Python
  
### ii.OpenCV
  
### iii.Tensorflow
  
### iv.CUDA
  
### v.Other Libraries
